# SMART CONTRACT

Solidity smart contracts enable highly secure digital transactions that don't involve third parties. Smart contracts are baked into blockchain technology, making them traceable, transparent, irreversible, and immediate.


## DESCRIPTION

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behavior of accounts within the Ethereum state. Solidity is a curly-bracket language designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

### Getting Started-



#### Execuitng Program
*To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/. Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., myToken.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

*To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile myToken.sol" button.
Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the “myToken” contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
